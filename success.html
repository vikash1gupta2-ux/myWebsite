<h1>Our Journey <span style="float:right; font-size:16px;">Page 1 of 4</span></h1>

<p>
Our company, <span class="highlight">SKI Plastoware</span>, started working from 29th July, 2025.
From that day, it has been a success.
</p>

<p>
Our sales have been a roller coaster.
They were not constant.
Sometimes they decreased.
Sometimes they increased.
</p>

<p>
But we continued working hard.
We continued putting in effort.
</p>

<p>
And today, we are quite a successful company.
</p>

<p>
Do you know what else happened on 29th July, 2025?
</p>

<p>
In Chandigarh, 205 residents got Municipal Corporation challans for not segregating waste.
</p>

<p>
Pune doubled solar generation in a year but failed to improve air quality.
</p>

<p>
You must be thinking that none of these are related to you.
</p>

<p class="highlight">
So let's talk about what is related to you.

<h1>That Sweet Encounter <span style="float:right; font-size:16px;">Page 2 of 4</span></h1>

<p>
A random person.
Unaware of what was going to happen next in his life.
</p>

<p>
He was using a website called <span class="highlight">ChitChat</span>.
</p>

<p>
A person came.
He said: <span class="highlight">M.</span>
</p>

<p>
The random person skipped as fast as he could.
Honestly, that day he was faster than Vande Bharat as well.
</p>

<p>
Another person came.
</p>

<p>
And dropped a <span class="highlight">F19 nuclear weapon.</span>
</p>

<p>
BOOM.
</p>

<p>
Fun fact:
More people do not die from this nuclear weapon every year compared to Little Boy and Fat Man combined.
</p>

<p>
A F!? In this economy!?
<br>
Random person: Haan toh?
<br>
I am not aware of the F19's reaction, but the protagonist was so happy that he was talking to a girl after 32 years of his life (he's 19), that he smiled a lot.
</p>

<p>
To an extent that his parents asked him to go to sleep.
That means he had to leave that F19!?
</p>

<p>
What do you think the protagonist did?
<br>
What happened next?
<br>
Where are these two?
<br>
Is it a cliffhanger?
</p>

<p>
Wait... NO!
<br><br>
I guess you know it :)
<br>
And the protagonist is not limited to any books.
He's right in front of you.
Yeah, it's me.

<h1>Six Months Later <span style="float:right; font-size:16px;">Page 3 of 4</span></h1>

<p>
Its been 188 days since we know each other; almost 2 months; OH SORRY, 6 haan 6 months.
</p>

<p>
It was such a rooler coasting ride; That good morning streak?
</p>

<p>
I blocked you; haan you blocked me first. KHUSH?
</p>

<p>
Phir later I had existential crisis and I blocked you again, But you being a really good gentleman, texted me, even called me; and that all sorted, it was not that difficult HUH. Thanks to me ofc
</p>

<p>
30 August? You remember that day? Namrata call-bombed you and than finally busted my plan by calling at my home lol; sweet SWEET memories. Haha.

<h1>Will we still be friends? <span style="float:right; font-size:16px;">Page 4 of 4</span></h1>

<p>
Do you remember the first week after we met?
It went pretty good.
I sent you some messages, which ultimately got my ass blocked.
</p>

<p>
What will you do if I repeat that same thing, but right NOW?
</p>

<p>
You know what, Saumya;
You are the kind of girl I imagine lying next to on green grass and staring at the blue sky, doing nothing.
</p>

<p>
Your voice, or even your presence, feels like cold water at 3 AM.
Heavenly.
</p>

<p>
You are the kind of girl I always admired.
I always respected.
And I respect you for what you had been through in your 12th class.
</p>

<p>
You are my role model.
I look up to you as a role model, a teacher, a guru, a friend, a motivator...
Not a "the".
You are THE "THE".
</p>

<p>
Do you know what Saumya stands for?
No one must have told you this.
Let me tell you today.
</p>

<p>
Super Human<br>
Absolute Fun<br>
Ultra Kind<br>
Most fun to be around<br>
Yapper<br>
Amazing
</p>

<p>
If we go like this, your name is pretty short.
</p>

<p>
The way you smile?
It's just so heavenly.
</p>

<p>
I can look into those eyes all day, non-stop.
</p>

<p>
I always wanted to tell you this.
Again...
Do you feel the same I feel?
